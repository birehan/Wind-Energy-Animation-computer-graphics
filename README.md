WIND TURBINE
First before explaining about the simulation we will introduce what is wind turbine? How does it work and other basic concepts that are considered through the process.

A wind turbine is a device that converts the kinetic energy of wind into electrical energy.They are an increasingly important source of intermittent renewable energy,and are used in many countries to lower energy costs and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

Wind turbines are manufactured in a wide range of sizes with either horizontal or vertical axes.yet for this simulation we considered the horizontal axes turbines which are used most of the time in wind farms for commercial production of electrical power.They have low torque ripple which contributes to good reliability.
These horizontal axes turbines have large three-bladed horizontal axis turbines with the blades upwind of the tower  which produce the overwhelming majority of wind power in the world today. These blades are usually colored white daytime visibility by aircraft and range in length from 20 to 80.How ever for this simulation we have considered it to be 60m length.Even if the size and height of turbines increase year by year we consider the middle range both for the turbine size and  height .
